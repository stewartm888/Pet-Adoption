# Pet-Adoption
Fred's repo for the Pet Adoption Capstone Project


Our main data source is a dataset available at Kaggle.com on animal shelter records. Here are the tables we intend to use:
   
   train.csv - Tabular/text data for the training set
   
   test.csv - Tabular/text data for the test set
   
   breed_labels.csv â€“ Data dictionary on breed
   
   color_labels.csv - Data dictionary on color
   
   state_labels.csv - Data dictionary on location

A brief description of what you will do
  1. First, we will perform a data quality check and EDA on training and testing data, for
  example: analyzing missing values, summary statistics, data visualizations, scatter plots,
  and a correlation matrix. We may apply data manipulation depending on the quality of
  the data, for example: replacing missing data with mean, median, or other imputation
  techniques.

  2. Afterward, we will use machine learning techniques to narrow down the candidate
  variable list. Since our target variable is a categorical variable, it is a classification
  problem, so we will explore using classification approaches. The results of these prior
  steps will provide insight into the best format for our final model.
  
  3. Finally, we will build this model and further refine it through testing.

  4. If necessary, we will return to the first step and consider new traits to measure and model
  then repeat this process.
